getFullStats('eminem').then(stats => {
    console.log(stats);
});

//Get 50 latest posts by the user (or all posts if the user has < 50 posts)
getQuickStats('eminem').then(stats => {
    console.log(stats);
});

```



Tested with accounts upto 2003 posts. Instagram blocks too many repeated requests in a short period of time and as a result, your Promises may be rejected while analysing accounts with relatively large number of posts aggressively. If you plan to analyse accounts with large number of posts repeatedly over a short duration, I suggest you to use `getUserMediaAdvanced() ` function from [instapro](https://github.com/preethamvishy/instagram-node) in a loop with time interval to fetch all posts and then use the `getStats()`function from this package.

This will be fixed out of the box in future versions.
